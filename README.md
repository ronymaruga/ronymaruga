âš¡**Fun Fact:**
Your smartphone is *millions of times more powerful* than the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) that took astronauts to the Moon in 1969. The AGC had just **64KB of memory** and operated at **0.043 MHz**â€”thatâ€™s slower than a basic calculator app today! Yet, it guided a spacecraft 384,000 km through space and landed it on another world. ðŸš€ðŸ“±

**Joke:**
